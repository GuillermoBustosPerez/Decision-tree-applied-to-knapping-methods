## **Decision-tree-applied-to-knapping-methods**  

This repostory contains:  
  * -.ods file named "Spread sheet template for ML". This is an open office spread sheet acting as a template. The template contains the variables employed to generate the ML decision tree model and to do predictios.   
  * -.R file named "Claculating technological variables.R" containing code to perform calculations employed to generate the ML model and make predictions.  
  * -.R file named "Making predictions using the models.R". This script contains instructions on how to make predictions of knapping methods using the models and variables generated uusing the Spread sheet template and the calculating tchnological variables script  
  * -.Rdata named "Model including fragments.Rdata". This is the decision tree model generated using artifacts and fragments  
  * -.Rdata named "Model of only complete artifacts.Rdata". This is the decision tree model generated using only complete artifacts
